# TheLostLogonScript

Dear programmer,

When I wrote this code, only god and I knew how it worked. But now, even I have forgotten the inner workings of this script. It seems that only god truly understands it now.

I must warn you, if you are trying to optimize this routine and it fails (which it most surely will), please increase the counter as a warning for the next person. The total hours wasted here have already reached a staggering 254 hours.

I can only hope that whoever tries to decipher this code will have better luck than I did. Good luck to you, programmer. You'll need it.

Sincerely,
The Lost Logon Script
